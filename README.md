Alternate Current Radio (ACR) is a grass roots independent media network built from the ground up by a small group of likeminded rebels with a shared enthusiasm for personal freedom, individuality, and libertyâ€¦ not just here in what used to be a constitutional republic of states but for all the people of planet Earth.<br>

<a href="www.kodi.tv">Kodi</a> (formerly known as XBMC) is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub that can be installed on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS and Android, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls.
